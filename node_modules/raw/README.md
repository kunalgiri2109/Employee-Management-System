Plain HTML Templates with connect-assets support for express 3.X.

### Motivation.
I wanted to use Emberjs as it was intended on the client side so I just really need plain HTML to be served. However I want keep using connect-assets for my coffee scripts etc. So I made this.

### Usage.

```npm install raw```

In your config:

    raw = require 'raw'
    app.set 'view engine', 'raw'
    app.engine 'html', raw.__express
    
    
Useage:

* Is just plain HTML but to specified the assets use ```{{{js jquery}}}``` or ```{{{css style}}}``` These are the hooks into connect-assets

* specify blocks of html you want to use in different envioments start the block with ```{env production}``` end the block with ```{/env}```
